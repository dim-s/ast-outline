"""Structural grep — find pattern in code, return scope-annotated matches.

What this is
------------
A grep variant that returns matches annotated with their enclosing
declaration scope (class/function chain) and a kind classification
(``def`` / ``call`` / ``ref`` / ``import``). Filters out matches inside
comments and strings by default — the noise that raw grep can't
distinguish from real code.

The intended consumer is an LLM agent that today does:

    grep symbol → 20 hits → read 5 files to understand scope

and instead can do:

    ast-outline grep symbol → all hits with scope and kind in one call.

What this is NOT
----------------
Not an LSP, not a true symbol resolver. Classification is heuristic
and works at the lexical level (per-line for kind, per-byte for
scope). For polymorphism / type-aware "find references", use a real
LSP. For codemods with placeholder patterns, use ``ast-grep`` (a
separate Rust tool, unrelated to this).

Implementation overview
-----------------------
For each file collected via :func:`adapters.collect_files_with_stats`:

1. Read bytes, find every literal/regex match position.
2. Parse via the language adapter to get a Declaration IR with byte
   ranges.
3. For each match position, walk the IR to find the deepest
   declaration containing it (the enclosing scope).
4. Classify the match's kind by looking at line content (whether the
   line is a comment, an import statement, the declaration's own
   signature line, a call expression, etc.).
5. Group by file and render as a Markdown-flavored outline showing
   only the scopes that contain matches.

Limitations of v1
-----------------
- String detection is a quote-counting heuristic — fails on multi-line
  strings, escaped quotes, raw strings, f-strings.
- Comment detection is keyword-prefix only — no block-comment tracking.
- Definition detection assumes match content equals the declaration's
  ``name``; works for class/method names, less reliably for variables.
- No regex captures or replacement — pure search.

    """Find ``patterns`` across ``paths``, return per-file annotated results.

    ``patterns`` may be a single string (back-compat) or a list of
    strings. All patterns share the same mode (``is_regex``,
    ``case_insensitive``, ``word_match``); they are combined into one
    alternation and matches surface together — the consumer reads
    which pattern hit each line from the line content itself, no
    per-pattern grouping.

    ``word_match`` wraps each pattern in ``\\b...\\b`` regex word
    boundaries (POSIX ``grep -w`` semantics). Forces regex mode since
    ``\\b`` is a regex construct; literals are escaped first so dots /
    parens / brackets in the pattern still match literally.

    ``max_count`` caps visible matches per file (POSIX ``grep -m``
    semantics). Cap is applied AFTER noise-filtering, so ``-m 5`` on
    a file with 100 string matches and 3 real ones still returns 3 —
    the cap counts what the agent will actually see, not what was
    pre-filtered. ``None`` (default) disables capping; ``0`` returns
    no matches per file (degenerate but well-defined).

    ``kind_filter`` restricts results to matches of the given kinds
    (``{"def", "call", "ref", "import", "comment", "string"}``). Filtered-
    out matches are dropped silently — they're not "hidden noise" the
    agent might want, they're explicitly excluded by the user's narrowing.
    Caller is responsible for setting ``include_noise=True`` if the
    filter contains ``comment``/``string``; otherwise the noise filter
    runs first and would zero out those kinds before this filter ever
    sees them.

    Returns a tuple of (file_results, ignored_dirs_count,
    kind_excluded_counts). When ``include_noise=False`` (the default),
    matches inside comments and strings are counted but filtered out
    of the result.

    ``kind_excluded_counts`` aggregates, across all files, how many
    matches were silently dropped by the ``kind_filter`` narrow —
    keyed by kind (``"ref"``, ``"call"``, ...). Always empty when
    ``kind_filter is None``. The CLI uses this on the empty-result
    path to tell the agent which kinds DID match, so a 0-result
    "no matches" doesn't mask the fact that the symbol is present
    in a different role (e.g. ``EditorPrefs.GetString(...)`` under
    ``--kind call`` — the dot makes ``EditorPrefs`` a ``ref``, not
    a ``call``).

    Empty patterns return no results — ``bytes.find(b"")`` returns 0
    at every position and would fire a "match" on every byte of every
    file, which is never what the caller wants.

    Walks past whitespace, generic-arg blocks (``<...>`` or ``[...]``
    balanced), bare generic closers ``>`` / ``]`` left over from a
    match that already consumed the opener, turbofish (``::``), TS
    optional-chain (``?.``), and TS non-null (``!``) until either
    ``(`` is found (→ True) or any other significant character is
    hit (→ False).

    Before any of those, a one-shot rest-of-identifier skip handles
    the case where the match ended *inside* a word. Two real
    scenarios feed this:

    1. Regex alternation ``foo|fooBar`` against ``fooBar(x)`` —
       Python ``re`` picks the leftmost alternative ``foo``, the
       match ends on ``B`` (mid-identifier ``Bar``).
    2. Literal substring search ``foo`` against ``fooBar(x)`` —
       same shape, different entry point (``bytes.find`` returns
       the match end at the same mid-identifier position).

    Without skipping the hidden tail every ``(`` is invisible to
    the walker and the call classifies as ``ref``. Symmetric to
    the bare-closer skip below — both cover matches whose end
    position doesn't align with a token boundary. Applies only at
    the entry position, not mid-walk, since legitimate intermediate
    identifiers (e.g. ``foo<T>bar()``) aren't a real-language shape.

    The bare-closer skip handles two real cases:

    1. ``ast-outline grep "Bind.*SaveSystem"`` (regex, greedy). The
       match ``Bind<SaveSystem`` ends on ``>`` — the walker starts
       on the closer with no matching opener to skip. Without the
       closer-skip, every generic call on the line classifies as
       ``ref`` instead of ``call``.
    2. ``ast-outline grep "Bind<SaveSystem>"`` (literal). The match
       ends past ``>``, on ``(`` — already handled by the trailing
       paren check; not affected by this branch.

    Covers ``<...>`` (C# / Java / Kotlin / Scala-types / TS / Rust /
    C++) and ``[...]`` (Go 1.18+ generics, Scala type-args).

    Caveats:
    - Bracket balancing is naive: ``a < b ? c : d`` could be misread
      as starting an unbalanced ``<`` block. In real code this rarely
      coincides with a function call shape; agents asking "is this a
      call?" are happy with ~99% precision.
    - Comparisons ``x = a < b > (c)`` look the same as a TS generic
      call. We err on the side of classifying as call — it's the
      rarer false positive in code-search contexts. The closer-skip
      extends the same bias to patterns like ``a > (c)`` where a
      match ending on ``>`` is now treated as a call if ``(`` follows;
      this is consistent policy across the walker.
    - Identifier skip is Unicode-aware (``isalpha()`` /
      ``isdecimal()`` / ``_``), so Cyrillic / CJK / accented-Latin
      identifiers compose with the same alternation-leftmost-wins
      shape as ASCII. Companion to the byte→codepoint conversion
      at the boundary in ``_annotate_matches`` — without that
      conversion the walker lands at the wrong codepoint and a
      Unicode-aware skip can't help; without the broader skip the
      conversion lands at the right codepoint but stops on the
      next identifier char. The two fixes are necessary together.
      Narrower than ``isalnum()`` on purpose: that wider check
      would also accept Unicode No-category numerics (``²``,
      ``¼``) which are not identifier chars in any supported
      language; treating them as identifier tail would extend
      the call-bias policy to contrived shapes that don't arise
      in real code. Known gap (not introduced by this patch):
      combining marks (Devanagari virama, vowel signs, Arabic
      diacritics — Mn/Mc categories) are XID_Continue in Python /
      Rust / JS / Swift but ``isalpha()`` returns False for them;
      a regex alternation whose shorter prefix ends right before
      a combining mark would stop the skip and classify as ref.
      Practical risk is low — combining-mark identifiers normalize
      to NFC and rarely surface in source code searches. The other char-class checks below (``<`` /
      ``>`` / ``::`` / ``?.`` / ``!``) stay ASCII — they're
      language-syntax markers, not identifier content.
    - Substring matches against a longer identifier now classify as
      call: ``foo`` against ``fooBar(x)`` → ``[call]`` (was ``[ref]``).
      This is intentional and consistent with the documented "bias
      toward call" — agents searching for a substring inside a
      called identifier usually want the call site surfaced. False
      positives (``foo`` against ``fooBar = 1``) still classify as
      ``ref`` because the trailing ``(`` check fails.
