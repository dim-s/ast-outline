r"""PHP adapter — parses .php / .phtml / .php8 files via tree-sitter-php into
Declaration IR. Targets modern PHP (8.x) and earlier LTS lines (7.4).

Design notes (how PHP concepts map to the IR):

- `namespace_definition` (file-scoped, semicolon-style) → KIND_NAMESPACE
                                                         (absorbs trailing
                                                         sibling types like
                                                         the C# / Java
                                                         file-scoped namespace)
- `namespace_definition` (bracketed `namespace Foo { ... }`) → KIND_NAMESPACE
                                                              (children come
                                                              from its inner

- `class_declaration`                  → KIND_CLASS  (regular / `abstract`
                                                     / `final` / `readonly`)
- `interface_declaration`              → KIND_INTERFACE
- `trait_declaration`                  → KIND_INTERFACE  (native_kind="trait";
                                                          mixin-style mapping
                                                          mirrors Scala / Rust
                                                          for cross-language
                                                          search uniformity)
- `enum_declaration`                   → KIND_ENUM  (PHP 8.1+, with optional
                                                    backed scalar type)
- `enum_case`                          → KIND_ENUM_MEMBER
- `function_definition` (top-level)    → KIND_FUNCTION
- `function_definition` (inside type)  → KIND_METHOD  (rare — PHP doesn't
                                                       allow this except via
                                                       trait composition,
                                                       handled defensively)
- `method_declaration`                 → KIND_METHOD,  except:
    `__construct`                      → KIND_CTOR
    `__destruct`                       → KIND_DTOR
- `property_declaration`               → KIND_FIELD  (one entry per
                                                     `property_element`
                                                     so `public $a, $b;`
                                                     surfaces both names —
                                                     same shape PHP would
                                                     report at runtime)
- `property_promotion_parameter`       → KIND_FIELD  (PHP 8.0+ ctor property
                                                     promotion — implicit
                                                     property declared via
                                                     `__construct(public ... $x)`,
                                                     surfaced as a field on
                                                     the enclosing type so
                                                     the outline shows them
                                                     even when the body is
                                                     empty)
- `const_declaration` (class member)   → KIND_FIELD  (class constant)
- `const_declaration` (top-level)      → KIND_FIELD  (file-level constant)

PHP-specific points:

- Property names lose their leading `$` in the IR: `private string $name;`
  → name="name". This matches how PHP source actually accesses the property
  (`$this->name`, not `$this->$name`) and lets symbol-search treat
  `User.name` like any other dotted path.
- `use_declaration` inside a class body declares trait composition
  (`use HasTimestamps;`) — these are skipped (they're imports of
  implementation, not declarations of new members).
- ``namespace_use_declaration`` (top-level ``use Foo\Bar;``,
  ``use function foo;``, ``use const FOO;``, grouped ``use Foo\{A, B};``)
  is emitted as imports.
- ``include`` / ``include_once`` / ``require`` / ``require_once``
  expressions are also emitted as imports — pre-Composer / WordPress /
  Drupal-7-style legacy code uses these as the *only* dependency
  mechanism, so an "imports = `use` only" view would show empty for
  every WP plugin file. Collection scope: top-level statements only
  (direct children of ``program``, plus the ``compound_statement``
  body of a bracketed namespace). We deliberately do **not** descend
  into ``if`` / ``else`` / ``try`` / ``switch`` / ``match`` / loop
  bodies, nor into function / method / class / closure bodies —
  conditional and runtime ``require``s are out of scope, matching how
  every other adapter handles conditional imports (Python
  ``try/except`` fallbacks, ``if TYPE_CHECKING`` blocks, and the
  like). One statement = one entry; the source-true expression text
  is preserved including computed paths
  (``require_once ABSPATH . 'wp-config.php'``).
- The skipped (conditional / runtime) include count is reported via
  ``ParseResult.conditional_imports_count``, which renderers expose
  as a ``[+ N conditional includes]`` suffix on the imports line.
  Counting them rather than listing them tells the agent
  "this file has additional dynamic dependencies — read it directly
  if you care" without misleading it into thinking all branches load
  every time.
  Grouped imports are expanded into one `use ...` entry per leaf so each
  `imports` string is a single source-true statement.
- Anonymous classes (`new class { ... }`) live inside expression nodes;
  the walker only descends into namespace bodies and class declaration
  lists, so anonymous classes are naturally skipped.

Visibility defaults (PHP spec):

- Top-level types / functions          → "public"  (no real concept of
                                                   non-public at top scope)
- Class members without modifier       → "public"
- Interface members                    → "public"  (always)
- Enum cases                           → "public"
- Class constants without modifier     → "public"  (PHP 7.1+ allows
                                                   modifiers on class
                                                   consts; absent ones
                                                   default to public)

Modifiers recognised: `abstract`, `final`, `readonly`, `static`, plus the
visibility tokens above. They appear as direct children of the declaration
node (`abstract_modifier`, `final_modifier`, `readonly_modifier`,
`static_modifier`, `visibility_modifier`).

Docs: PHPDoc `/** ... */` is a `comment` node whose text starts with `/**`.
Plain block comments (`/* ... */`) and `//` / `#` line comments don't
qualify and break the contiguous-leading-doc walk.

Attributes (PHP 8.0+ `#[Attr]` / `#[Attr(args)]`) are collected as `attrs`
and stripped from the rendered signature, the same way Java annotations and
Rust attribute macros are handled.
