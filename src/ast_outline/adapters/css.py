"""CSS adapter (.css).

Produces an IR that maps the stylesheet's structure for navigation:

    # styles.css (240 lines)
    .container                     L3-15
    .btn-primary, .btn-secondary   L17-28
    @media (max-width: 768px)      L30-50
        .container                 L31-49
    @keyframes fadeIn              L52-58
    @supports (display: grid)      L60-72
        .grid                      L61-71

Each rule's `match_names` carries the bare simple-selector tokens
extracted from its selector list — `find_symbols(".btn-primary")`
returns every rule whose selectors include `.btn-primary` in any
position (direct, descendant, with pseudo-class, with attribute
filter), which is what an agent debugging a cascade actually wants.
At-rule wrappers (`@media`, `@supports`, `@layer`, `@keyframes`,
`@container`) become `KIND_AT_RULE` parents whose inner rules are
children — so the outline reflects the conditional nesting and
`show .btn` inside a `@media` block shows the wrapping context as
breadcrumb.

The `:root { --token: value; }` block is NOT broken out into a
catalog of custom-property declarations. Each `:root` (and themed
selectors like `[data-theme=dark]`) is one rule; querying
`show :root` returns the whole token block. The decision is intentional:
custom-property names with leading `--` collide with CLI flag parsing,
and breaking them out as separate symbols would invent a new API
surface (kind tags, dotted query forms) that no other adapter has.
Per-token resolution can be added later if real-world use demands it,
without breaking anything.
