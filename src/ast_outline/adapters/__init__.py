"""Language adapters — parse source into Declaration IR.

Each adapter knows: a set of file extensions it handles, and how to convert
tree-sitter AST nodes for its language into the `core.Declaration` tree.

Directory traversal also lives here. ``collect_files`` walks input dirs,
filters out junk (``.gitignore`` patterns + a small hardcoded fallback list
covering ``.git`` / ``node_modules`` / ``__pycache__`` / ``.venv`` / ``venv``),
and prunes ignored directories at walk time so we don't pay the cost of
descending into ``node_modules`` just to throw the files away.
