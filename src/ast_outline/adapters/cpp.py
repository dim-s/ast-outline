"""C++ adapter — parses .cpp/.h files via tree-sitter-cpp into Declaration IR.

Design notes (how C++ concepts map to the IR):

- ``namespace_definition``         → KIND_NAMESPACE. C++17 nested namespace
                                     (``namespace a::b::c { }``) lands as
                                     a single declaration with name
                                     ``a::b::c``. Old-style nested
                                     ``namespace a { namespace b { … } }``
                                     where each level holds exactly one
                                     namespace and nothing else is
                                     transparently collapsed into the
                                     same single-line form, so the
                                     outline reads the same regardless
                                     of which spelling the source uses.
                                     Anonymous namespaces render as
                                     ``namespace <anonymous>``; inline
                                     namespaces keep the keyword in the
                                     name (``namespace inline v1``).
- ``class_specifier``              → KIND_CLASS. Default member visibility
                                     is ``private`` per the C++ language
                                     spec — applied unless an
                                     ``access_specifier`` block (``public:``
                                     / ``protected:``) precedes the member.
- ``struct_specifier``             → KIND_STRUCT. Default visibility
                                     ``public``.
- ``union_specifier``              → KIND_STRUCT with ``native_kind="union"``
                                     so the digest renders ``union Foo``
                                     while symbol search treats it like a
                                     struct. Union variants carry the
                                     ``union`` keyword in the signature.
- ``enum_specifier``               → KIND_ENUM. Both classic ``enum`` and
                                     C++11 ``enum class`` / ``enum struct``
                                     map here; the keyword form is
                                     preserved in the signature so an
                                     agent can tell strongly-typed enums
                                     apart at a glance. Enumerators
                                     surface as KIND_ENUM_MEMBER children.
- ``template_declaration``         → transparent wrapper. The template
                                     header (``template<typename T, …>``)
                                     becomes the prefix of the wrapped
                                     declaration's signature; the IR
                                     declaration is the inner type or
                                     function, not the template node.
- ``function_definition`` /
  ``declaration`` w/ function_declarator
  at file or namespace scope       → KIND_FUNCTION (free function).
- The same nodes inside a class body  → KIND_METHOD / KIND_CTOR / KIND_DTOR /
                                     KIND_OPERATOR depending on the
                                     declarator's name shape (identifier,
                                     destructor_name, operator_name,
                                     operator_cast). ``= default`` /
                                     ``= delete`` clauses are kept in the
                                     signature.
- ``field_declaration`` (data)     → KIND_FIELD.
- ``friend_declaration``           → skipped — declares relationships, not
                                     members of the current scope.
- ``preproc_include``              → ``imports`` entry, source-true
                                     (``#include <vector>`` /
                                     ``#include "foo.h"``). Other
                                     preprocessor directives (``#define``,
                                     ``#if``) are deliberately ignored —
                                     they're not dependencies.

Out-of-class definitions like ``void Widget::draw() const { … }`` at file
scope render as free functions whose name is the qualified form
(``Widget::draw``). The adapter does not attempt to re-attach them to
their declaring class — that would need cross-file resolution and is the
job of a real C++ frontend, not a tree-sitter outline. The ``::`` in the
name keeps the relationship visible to anyone reading the outline.

Unreal Engine reflection macros are recognised by default and surface
on the next declaration as attrs (mirroring how the C# adapter
captures ``[Attribute]`` decorators). The mapping is:

- ``UCLASS(...)``, ``USTRUCT(...)``, ``UENUM(...)``,
  ``UINTERFACE(...)``, ``UDELEGATE(...)`` — at file or namespace
  scope, attached as an attr on the next type declaration.
- ``UPROPERTY(...)``, ``UFUNCTION(...)`` — inside a class / struct
  body, attached as an attr on the next field or method.
- ``GENERATED_BODY()`` family — silently skipped. They're UHT
  (Unreal Header Tool) markers with no semantic content for an
  outline reader.

This is opt-out only by virtue of writing non-UE code (the macros
simply don't appear). The list is restricted to the canonical UE
macro names — other macros (Qt's ``Q_OBJECT``, generic
``DECLARE_DELEGATE_*``, app-specific declarations) parse as plain
function-call expressions without being absorbed, so they remain
visible in the outline as separate lines instead of silently
disappearing.

Note on ``*_API`` DLL-export macros (``ENGINE_API``, ``GAME_API``,
…): without preprocessor expansion tree-sitter mis-parses
``class GAME_API AMyActor`` as a function definition. The adapter
does not work around this. In typical UE projects the macro
expands to ``__declspec(dllexport)`` / empty when the build
system pre-processes; when running ast-outline against bare
source the simplest workaround is to drop the macro before
parsing or accept that those classes won't outline cleanly.
